# 🎧 Playflowr

**Playflowr** is a personal tool to analyze, organize and make sense of your music playlists — starting with your liked tracks.

Instead of blindly auto-sorting your music, Playflowr focuses on **analysis, transparency and user control**.  
It proposes playlists based on musical signals and listening history, without ever modifying your original library.

## 🧠 Why Playflowr?

Spotify’s *Liked Songs* playlist often becomes a chaotic mix of moods, phases and inspirations over time.

Playflowr helps you:
- understand what’s inside that chaos
- detect musical patterns and phases
- generate **meaningful playlist proposals**
- stay in control of every decision

Nothing is deleted. Nothing is moved automatically.  
Playflowr **suggests — you decide**.

## ✨ Core principles

- 🔒 **Safe by design**  
  Your liked tracks are never modified or removed.

- 🧠 **Semi-automatic**  
  The app proposes playlists, the user validates them.

- 🔍 **Explainable**  
  Every recommendation is based on clear musical signals (energy, tempo, valence, etc.).

- 🌍 **Platform-agnostic vision**  
  Spotify is the first integration, not the last one.
